## üöÄ Features  
- Face Recognition‚Äìbased authentication using ESP32-CAM.  
- Automatic door unlocking with solenoid lock and relay control.  
- No physical keys or RFID cards required.  
- Web-based streaming interface for live monitoring.  
- Supports multiple face enrollments.  
- Low-cost and compact design suitable for DIY security systems.

## üõ†Ô∏è Hardware Requirements  

| Component        | Quantity | Description |
|------------------|----------|-------------|
| ESP32-CAM Module | 1        | AI-Thinker ESP32 with OV2640 Camera |
| FTDI Programmer  | 1        | For uploading code (USB to Serial) |
| Relay Module     | 1        | To switch the solenoid lock |
| Solenoid Lock    | 1        | 12V DC electronic lock |
| Power Supply     | 1        | 12V @ 500mA for solenoid |
| Jumper Wires     | As req.  | For connections |

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works  
1. ESP32-CAM streams live video feed over Wi-Fi.  
2. User enrolls face(s) via the web interface.  
3. When a recognized face appears, ESP32 triggers the relay.  
4. Relay energizes the solenoid lock, unlocking the door for 5 seconds.  
5. After timeout, the lock automatically re-engages.

### Pin Mapping  

| ESP32-CAM | FTDI Programmer | Relay Module |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|
| 5V        | VCC             | VCC          |
| GND       | GND             | GND          |
| UOR       | TX              | -            |
| UOT       | RX              | -            |
| IO0 ‚Üí GND | Boot Mode       | -            |
| IO4       | -               | IN           |

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note:** Connect IO0 to GND before flashing code. Remove after programming.

## üß† Troubleshooting  

| Issue | Possible Cause | Solution |
|-------|----------------|----------|
| Code not uploading | IO0 not grounded | Connect IO0 ‚Üí GND before flashing |
| Camera not detected | Wrong board selected | Use **ESP32 Wrover Module** in Arduino IDE |
| Lock not working | Relay wiring issue | Check IN pin connection to IO4 |
| Face not recognized | Poor lighting / camera angle | Enroll face under good lighting conditions |
| ESP not starting | Insufficient power | Use stable 5V supply for ESP32-CAM |
